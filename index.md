- How important is the program flow for yourself?
- How important is the program flow for your collaborators?


## A standard for the program flow

We have learned how to make a git repository for a single person and share it with several people. In this lesson we will combine this knowledge and use it to do a modular-based code development. We will discover the pros of dividing our code into functions through a simple python script.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> 1. Basic understanding of Git.
> 2. You need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account.
>
> We will do this exercise on [GitHub](https://github.com) but also
> [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) allow
> similar workflows and basically everything that we will discuss is transferable. With
> this material and these exercises we do not endorse the company
> [GitHub](https://github.com). We have chosen to demonstrate a number of
> concepts using examples with [GitHub](https://github.com) because it is
> currently the most popular web platform for hosting Git repositories and the chance is high
> that you will interact with [GitHub](https://github.com)-based repositories even if you
> choose to host your Git repository on another platform.
