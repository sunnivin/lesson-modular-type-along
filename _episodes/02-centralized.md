layout: episode
title: Thoughts before doing the exercise
teaching: 15
exercises: 5
questions:
  - How can we collaborate with others within one repository?
objectives:
  - Understand how to collaborate using a centralized workflow.
  - Understand the difference between local branch, origin/branch, and remote branch.
keypoints:
  - Centralized workflow is often used for remote collaborative work.
  - "`origin` refers to where you cloned from (but you can relocate it)."
  - "`origin/mybranch` is a read-only pointer to branch `mybranch` on `origin`."
  - "These read-only pointers only move when you `git fetch`/`git pull` or `git push`."

## Starting questions for the collaborative document
We share these questions in a common [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/GjKgLZ5jRYGPAbuPkCfGtw) and we wait until we have sufficiently many answers to question 1. But we also encourage answering other questions which we revisit at the end of the demo.

1. What does “modular code development” mean for you?
2. What best practices can you recommend to arrive at well structured, modular code in your favourite programming language?
3. What do you know now about programming that you wish somebody told you earlier?


## Additional questions
4. Do you design a new code project on paper before coding? Discuss pros and cons.
5. Do you build your code top-down or bottom-up? Discuss pros and cons.
6. Would you prefer your code to be 2x slower if it was easier to read it?
