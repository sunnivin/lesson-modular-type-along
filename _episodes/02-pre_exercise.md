## Questions to answer **before** the exercise



> ## Discussion: Best practice for modular coding
>
> We share these questions in a common [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/GjKgLZ5jRYGPAbuPkCfGtw) and we wait until we have sufficiently many answers to question 1.
> ### Questions:
> > 1. What does “modular code development” mean for you?
> > 2. What best practices can you recommend to arrive at well structured, modular code in your favourite programming language?
> > 3. What do you know now about programming that you wish somebody told you earlier?
> > 4. Do you design a new code project on paper before coding? Discuss pros and cons.
> > 5. Do you build your code top-down or bottom-up? Discuss pros and cons.
> > 6. Would you prefer your code to be 2x slower if it was easier to read it?
